First, I want you to know that I take your privacy very seriously. I don’t keep your personal data and, frankly, I don’t want it. The only information that I know about you is what might be communicated through a Bug/Feature request. This app was created because I wanted to make people’s lives a little bit easier, not because I wanted to farm out it’s users for their data.



The only data you share with the app is your location, which is requested by standard iOS privacy prompts. Your location is used to:

Display your current location when opening up the map, and
To limit the search results to places of interest near you.
This data data is only used within the app.

I may recieve anonymous analytics from Apple if you, the user, opt in for that as well as general information that Apple provides to all developers.But if you have any questions whatsoever, reach out to me through the app and I’d love to help clear anything up! Thanks for using BeenThere!



Now the boring part…
